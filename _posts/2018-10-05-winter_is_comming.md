# The Road Not Taken

> Two roads diverged1 in a yellow wood,  
> And sorry I could not travel both  
> And be one traveler, long I stood  
> And looked down one as far as I could  
> To where it bent2 in the undergrowth3.  

> Then took the other, as just as fair4,  
> And having perhaps the better claim5,  
> Because it was grassy6 and wanted wear7;  
> Though as for that the passing there  
> Had worn8 them really about the same.  

> And both that morning equally9 lay  
> In leaves no step had trodden10 back.  
> Oh, I kept the first for another day!  
> Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  
> I doubted if I should ever come back.  

> I shall be telling this with a sigh11  
> Somewhere ages12 and ages hence13:  
> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--  
> I took the one less traveled by,  
> And that has made all the difference.
